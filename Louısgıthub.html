<p> 对AI绘画的理解
  AI绘画能否代替真人绘画引起激烈讨论，你觉得AI的画有艺术价值吗？
  AI绘画能否代替真人绘画引起激烈讨论，AI的话当然是不具备艺术价值的，因为本身就不蕴含着任何人类情感。
  一、AI绘画能否代替真人绘画引起激烈讨论
  此前某公司的AI机器人绘画的作品以高价拍卖出去，这引发了许多人对于AI绘画能否替代真人绘画的激烈讨论，但是经过一番论证以后，更多人倾向于认为AI做法是并不存在艺术价值的。尽管某教授对于AI作画的水平表示认同，但是我们必须对艺术价值进行重新解读。
  二、AI绘画毫无艺术价值可言
  其实什么叫做绘画的艺术价值？绘画的艺术价值本身就来源于人类的情感，梵高的向日葵之所以能够让人看出生命的绽放，那就是因为里面赋予了梵高对于艺术所有的热情以及所有的情感。AI是没有人格的，AI只是精通作画技巧，而且也知道市面上的消费者喜欢什么样子的画，AI自然也就会模仿相应的，大家利用相应的技巧做法最后做出来的话不会太差，但是也好不到哪里去。更何况AI本身就没有人格，没有人格就没有人类的情感，没有情感自然也就没有办法绘画出有艺术价值的话。
  三、我们应该对于人的创造力自信一些
  随着目前某科技公司的AI画出了一副好作品，同时这部好作品也已经被他人以高价购买，这当然引发了不少行业从业者的担忧，毕竟他们本身的产品就不是那么好卖了，现在一幅AI随便画的画都能够受到这么多的追捧，当然也就引发了大家的恐慌。行业很卷是一个客观的情形，但是更加需要知道的是人的创造力也是很强的，我们应该对自己的创造能力更加自信一些，千万不要觉得AI作画就能够超越人类。
  Understanding of AI Painting
  Whether AI painting can replace human painting has aroused heated discussion. Do you think AI painting has artistic value?
  Whether AI painting can replace human painting has aroused heated discussion. Of course, AI's words do not have artistic value, because they do not contain any human emotion.
  1、 Whether AI painting can replace human painting arouses heated discussion
  Previously, the works of AI robot painting of a company were auctioned at a high price, which triggered a heated discussion among many people about whether AI painting could replace human painting. However, after some argumentation, more people tend to think that AI practice has no artistic value. Although a professor agreed with the level of AI painting, we must re interpret the artistic value.
  2、 AI painting has no artistic value
  In fact, what is the artistic value of painting? The artistic value of painting itself comes from human emotions. The reason why Van Gogh's sunflower can let people see the bloom of life is that it gives Van Gogh all his passion for art and all his emotions. AI has no personality. AI is only proficient in painting skills, but also knows what kind of paintings consumers like. AI will naturally imitate the corresponding ones. If everyone uses the corresponding skills and practices, it will not be too bad, but it will not be much better. What's more, AI itself has no personality. Without personality, there would be no human emotion. Without emotion, there would be no way to paint words of artistic value.
  3、 We should be confident in people's creativity
  At present, the AI of a technology company has drawn a good work, and at the same time, this good work has been bought by others at a high price, which of course has aroused the concern of many practitioners in the industry. After all, their own products are not so easy to sell. Now a casual painting of AI can be so popular, which of course has triggered panic. It is an objective situation that the industry is very voluminous, but what we need to know more is that people's creativity is also strong. We should be more confident about our creativity, and never think that AI painting can surpass human beings. </p>
